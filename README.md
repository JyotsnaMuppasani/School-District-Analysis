# School-District-Analysis
## Overview of Project:
Maria has a new data of complete list of student and school. We are playing Maria and analyzing the dataset and giving a summary of the analysis. In this challenge we will be using the Jupyter notebook and pandas for analyzing the data.
## Deliverables are:
* Deliverable 1: Collect the student data into a DataFrame.
* Deliverable 2: Prepare a cleaned version of the DataFrame.
* Deliverable 3: Summarize key pieces of the data.
* Deliverable 4: Drill down into the data to analyze specific subsets.
* Deliverable 5: Compare and contrast the data through grouping and aggregation functions.
* Deliverable 6: A written analysis of your results (README.md).

## Report Findings and Summary:
The analysis of the new full student data shows that Public school had high budget compared to the charter school. Math score and reading scores were relatively high in Charter school compared to public school. Except for grade 12, all the others grades had better math scores in charter school. There were significant number of null values, 1968 for reading scores and 982 for math score. Also 1836 duplicated values were there which had to be removed from analysis. because significant numbers were dropped because of null values there is a chance that the data might be skewed. Missing data might be replaced by unknown, 0 or mean value, these outputs might show if data is affected because of dropping the missing data. Montgomery High school had highest number of students and Chang high school had least. Another data frame can be created to see data grouped by school type, grade and school name to see which school is better for match and reading for each grade.
